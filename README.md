## Terminology:
- Boolean: is it true or false. 
- Conditional: If something is related to something else than something happens.
- Array: A list of items that are grouped together inside of a variable. 
- Loop: A way to cycle through an array for the purpose of doing things with the individual items inside the array. 
- Object:  var person = {firstName: Tom;  lastName: Rau; height: 6’0”; }
- Function: A named* set of directions inside a computer program.  
- Variable: Variables store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program. They also provide a way      of labeling data with a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves. It      is helpful to think of variables as containers that hold information. Their sole purpose is to label and store data in        memory. This data can then be used throughout your program.


## Gotchas: 

1. Order Matters.
2. Global vs Local
3. Debugging is of the utmost importance. Console.log is your best friend (for now). 
4. Nice function, why isn’t it doing anything?
5. Now that I’m coding how do i wire it all together to work in a browser window?
