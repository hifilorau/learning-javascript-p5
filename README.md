# learning-javascript-p5
A crash course in Javascript and p5.js

## Terminology:
- Boolean: is it true or false. 
- Conditional: If something is related to something else than something happens.
- Array: A list of items that are grouped together inside of a variable. 
- Loop: A way to cycle through an array for the purpose of doing things with the individual items inside the array. 
- Object:  var person = {firstName: Tom;  lastName: Rau; height: 6’0”; }
- Function: A named* set of directions inside a computer program.  


## Gotchas: 

1. Order Matters.
2. Global vs Local
3. Debugging is of the utmost importance. Console.log is your best friend (for now). 
4. Nice function, why isn’t it doing anything?
5. Now that I’m coding how do i wire it all together to work in a browser window?
